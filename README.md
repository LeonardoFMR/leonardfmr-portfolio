## 🛠️ Technologies and methodologies applied

- **BEM (Block Element Modifier):** to maintain clean, semantic, and scalable code.  
- **Atomic Design:** to structure components in a logical and reusable way.  
- **Semantic HTML and modular CSS:** to ensure clarity and organization in the codebase.

## 🖼️ Image management

- Images relevant to content, identity, or context are integrated directly in the HTML.
